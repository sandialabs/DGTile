Welcome to the DGTile documentation.

DGTile is a C++17 adaptive mesh library meant to support explicit
and semi-implicit discontinuous Galerkin finite element applications
on high-performance computers.

Broadly speaking, this documentation is broken into the following
three separate categories:

* :ref:`Deployment<deployment>` (obtainment, compilation, and installation) of the code.
* :ref:`Usage<usage>` of various features of the code.
* :ref:`Theory<theory>` of the data structures, numerical methods, and algorithms.
